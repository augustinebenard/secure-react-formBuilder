## Description
This is a dynamic form builder built with **React**, **Vite**, **Bootstrap**, **Yup**, **React Icons**, and **Sonner**. 
The application allows users to create forms dynamically by adding, removing, and reordering various input fields (text, email, number, date, etc.). It features schema-based client-side validation with Yup and interactive notifications using Sonner.

## Features
- **Dynamic Fields:** Add, remove, and reorder form fields on the fly.
- **Multiple Field Types:** Supports text, email, number, and date inputs.
- **Validation:** Uses Yup for schema-based validation including required fields and type-specific validations.
- **Interactive Notifications:** Displays success or error notifications using the Sonner package.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS to ensure a responsive and centered layout.
- **Custom Icons:** Uses React Icons (e.g., a trash icon for field removal) for a modern interface.
